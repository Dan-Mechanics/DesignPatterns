the decorator needs to be like the one from equilbruium.

make sure to not include text mesh pro because is laggy ish.
maybe for input we can look at oobserver instead of command
but i feel like in this context command is better becasue obserover
has eventmanger connotiations.

also need to make sure the object pool is fine tuned for gameobject specifically,
we are still useing unity here after all so yeah. also look to keep the code somewhat SOLID.

===

i want to make it so that
i have custom bidnigns input
and then cool decorator for the gun and 
then objectpool for the gameobjects of the bullets
and then FSM cocnept which i already have somewhat for the reloading
and silencer remover.

the inputs of the state machine would prolly be the key presses /
shoot
reload
silencer

or some other action

maybe inspect even.
