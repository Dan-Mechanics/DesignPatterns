i want it to be that i have my own cool custom input thing which
is in fact NOT the unity standard one because that is too complicated for me

and i also want to make a simple paint esque tool.

but since today i am tired i will make just the bare minimum work.


dont forget builder im not quite happy with that yet,
and also ask valetnijn / aaron for decorator lore.
